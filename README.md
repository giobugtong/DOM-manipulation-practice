PH Government just announced yesterday the the NCR Plus bubble (NCR, Cavite, Laguna, Bulacan, Rizal) will be on Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine from today until the 30th. I guess another birthday spent in what essentially is a lockdown.

Learning all these technologies hopefully helps me in landing a job in tech by late 2021. I still plan on enrolling in a coding boot camp, probably Zuitt.
